tried to clone hte dingboard. i was able to do almost but later i started preparing for interviews; if anyone interested they can continue the work.
AI related task are pending. we can integrate small AI models and use it in web assembly so that we dont use any server. dingboard uses server i guess 
for half of the model (SAM model). i wanted to use FastSAM (R&D) was done. but yeah , for background removal there is a model by tiktok(bytedance?)
so, if i get time, patience back, i might implement it(ðŸ¤ž).
